\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this report, we have thouroughly analysed and simulate a multi-branched RC circuit, figure (\ref{fig:1}).
\\
We managed to describe the circuit while in its stationary state using the Nodal Method, when $t < 0 \:s$, as well as
how it responded to a sine wave stimulus, when $t > 0 \: s$, obtaining the total solution by superimposing the natural
and forced solutions, which we got by computing the equivalent resistance and the voltage phasors, respectively.
We also analysed how the circuit responded to a range of frequencies established by the input source and explained 
the derived results.
Furthermore, both the theoretical and simulated analysis produced almost identical data, which further emphasizes the
exactness of the obtained results.
\\
In conclusion, all the established objectives in section (\ref{sec:introduction}) have been accomplished since we
could accurately describe the behaviour of the RC circuit given.
