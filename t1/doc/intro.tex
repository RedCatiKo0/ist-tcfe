% state the learning objective 
The objective of this laboratory assignment is to study a circuit, Figure (\ref{fig:1}),
containing 7 resistors, an indepent current source, an independent voltage source, a voltage-dependent
current source and a current-dependent voltage source.
\\
In Section (\ref{sec:analysis}) we performed a theoretical analysis of the circuit using the mesh current method
and the nodal voltage method. The results were then calculated using an \emph{Octave} script which allowed us
to establish values for specific physical quantities in the circuit like $V_b$ and $I_c$.
\\
In Section (\ref{sec:simulation}) we present the results of a simulation of the circuit obtained from an
\emph{Ngspice} script and comment the difference between the values determined trough theoretical methods and
by using a simulation.
\\
Finally, in section (\ref{sec:conclusion}) we recapitulate the results of this assignment, namely the comparison between
the theoretical analysis and the simulation.
