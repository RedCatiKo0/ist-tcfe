\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this laboratory assignment we have analysed a simple linear circuit through both theoretical
and simulation methods. We have obtained values for node voltages and mesh currents as well as specific
physical quantities of the circuit ($V_b$ and $I_c$).
\\
In Section (\ref{sec:simulation}) we can see that the simulation values are coherent with the
theoretical predictions, this is not surprising considering we are dealing with a very simple linear
circuit and thefore there are no motives for significant differences.
\\
We can conclude that the main objectives of this lab assignment have been achieved and that for simple linear
circuits there are no significant differences between the theoretical models and the simulations.
